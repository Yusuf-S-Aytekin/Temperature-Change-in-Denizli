# Temperature Change in Denizli

- I created this graph for Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python course offered by Michigan on Coursera.

### Data Source

- This data is taken from Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd).
- The link is available [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily)

### About The Image

- The scatter plot represents the record-breaking temperature values from 2015. The line graph, on the other hand, represents the min and max temperature values of each month from 2005 through 2014.
- As you can see, there is no abnormal change in temperature values in this city.
